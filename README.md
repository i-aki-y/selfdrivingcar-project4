## Advanced Lane Finding
This is my solution of udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree's 'Advanced Lane Finding' project.


- AdvanLaneFinding.ipynb: The solution pipeline is written here.
- Calibration.ipynb: Camera calibration code is given
- Analysis.ipynb: Some example and experiment is performed in this file.
- utils.py: functions used in the solution pipeline are defined in this file.
- writeup.md: This is the writeup report.
- output_image/: images used in the writeup are stored in this directory
- output_data/: serialized data such as calibration matrix and warp matrix are stored in this directory
- output_video: The solution video files are saved in this directory
